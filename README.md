**Implemented a Feed Forward Neural Network on MNIST dataset achieving 88.5% accuracy**


Made the model completely from scratch with the help of numpy and pandas
**Dataset**
MNIST digit recognition dataset, which consists of 28×28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9). Each image is flattened into 784 pixel values, and the corresponding label indicates the digit class, making it a standard benchmark for image classification tasks.
